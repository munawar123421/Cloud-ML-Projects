# Bike Rental Demand Prediction using Azure AutoML

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) solution for predicting bike rental demand using Azure Machine Learning. The workflow covers data preparation, model training with AutoML, deployment as a web service, and performance monitoring.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Bike sharing hourly data (e.g., from UCI ML Repository)
- **Features**: 
  - Temporal (season, year, month, hour, weekday)
  - Weather (temp, humidity, windspeed)
  - Holiday/working day flags
- **Target**: `cnt` - Count of total bike rentals

## Azure ML Workflow

### 1. Workspace Setup
- Created Azure ML workspace
- Configured compute resources (CPU/GPU clusters)

### 2. Data Preparation
```python
# Sample code for data preprocessing
from azureml.core import Dataset

# Register dataset
dataset = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path)
dataset = dataset.register(workspace=ws, name='bike_rentals')
3. AutoML Training
Configured regression task with primary metric = Normalized Root Mean Squared Error

Enabled feature engineering

Set 30 iterations with 5-fold cross-validation

4. Model Deployment
Deployed best model as ACI web service

Enabled application insights for monitoring

API Consumption
python
import requests
import json

data = {
    "data": [{
        "season": 2,
        "hr": 15,
        "temp": 0.72,
        "hum": 0.43,
        "windspeed": 0.12
    }]
}

headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization': f'Bearer {key}'}
response = requests.post(endpoint, json.dumps(data), headers=headers)
print(response.json())
